# Learning Journeys

A collection of structured learning repositories tracking deep dives into various technologies and concepts.

## 🎯 Philosophy

This repository follows a deliberate learning approach:

- **Deep Dive** = 30+ min focused study with hands-on practice
- **Surface Level** = Basic understanding of what it is and when to use it
- **Retention Exercise** = Explain concept back without notes, get feedback

## 📊 Retention Scoring System

**🟢 Strong (90-100%)**: Ready to explain to colleagues
**🟡 Good (70-89%)**: Solid understanding with minor gaps
**🟠 Fair (50-69%)**: Basics understood, needs review
**🔴 Needs Review (<50%)**: Significant gaps, requires re-study

## 🗂️ Learning Journeys

### [EKS & Kubernetes](./eks/)
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Goal**: Build observability platform with Prometheus and Grafana on EKS

**Current Progress**:
- ✅ Kubernetes architecture fundamentals
- ✅ Pod and Service networking deep dives
- ✅ Ingress controllers (AWS Load Balancer Controller)
- 🔄 Building web app/db stack
- ⏳ Prometheus & Grafana observability prototype
- ⏳ SLO implementation
