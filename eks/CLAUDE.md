# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **learning repository** for EKS/Kubernetes concepts with the goal of building an observability platform using Prometheus and AWS-hosted Grafana. The repository tracks learning progress through documentation rather than containing production code.

## Project Goals (In Order)

1. ‚úÖ Learn EKS and Kubernetes fundamentals
2. ‚úÖ Write Terraform to build EKS cluster
3. üîÑ Build web app/db stack in cluster (IN PROGRESS - learning phase)
4. ‚è≥ Build observability prototype (Prometheus + Grafana)
5. ‚è≥ Build out SLOs

## Repository Structure

- `learning-plan.md` - Comprehensive learning plan with topics covered, retention scores, and next steps
- `learning-progress.md` - High-level tracking of completed topics and key mental models
- `eks.md` - Initial project requirements and goals

## Key Context for Future Development

### Topics Mastered (13/15 Core Fundamentals - 87%)
The owner has deep understanding of:
- Kubernetes architecture (control plane and data plane)
- Pod networking with AWS VPC CNI (ENIs, veth pairs, network namespaces)
- Service networking (ClusterIP, iptables, Endpoints)
- Ingress controllers (AWS Load Balancer Controller, ALB, IP vs Instance mode)
- DNS / Service Discovery (CoreDNS, Prometheus discovery, watch mechanisms)
- Workload Resources (Deployments, StatefulSets, resource limits, cgroups)
- ConfigMaps and Secrets (base64 encoding, AWS Secrets Manager, CSI Driver, Operators)
- Health Checks and Lifecycle (liveness, readiness, graceful shutdown)
- Storage Fundamentals (PV, PVC, StorageClasses, dynamic provisioning)
- RBAC and ServiceAccounts (roles, bindings, IRSA)
- Network Policies (Calico, ipsets, policy logic)
- Pod Security (SecurityContext, fsGroup, Pod Security Standards)
- Advanced Scheduling (taints/tolerations, affinity, anti-affinity)

### Critical Mental Models
See learning-progress.md for complete list (19 mental models). Key highlights:
- **Watch Loop Pattern** - Controllers continuously watch API server and reconcile state
- **Pod IPs are ephemeral** - Services provide stable ClusterIPs for abstraction
- **Taints are defensive** - Repel ALL pods unless they tolerate
- **Scheduling constraints are AND'd** - All must be satisfied simultaneously
- **topologyKey defines "near"** - hostname = same node, zone = same AZ

### Current Learning Plan
**Progress:** 13/15 topics complete (87%)
**Remaining:** 2 topics (~1 day)
**Average Retention:** 92%

**Next priorities:**
1. Resource Management (ResourceQuotas, LimitRanges, QoS)
2. Disruptions and Availability (PodDisruptionBudgets, HA patterns)

**After completion:** Begin observability platform implementation (Prometheus + Grafana)

## Development Commands

**Note:** No build, test, or deployment commands exist yet. When Terraform code is added:
- Standard Terraform workflow: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`
- When Kubernetes manifests are added: `kubectl apply -f <file>`

## Architecture Notes

### Networking Decisions
- **Ingress Mode**: IP mode preferred over Instance mode (direct pod IP targeting, lower latency)
- **ALB Architecture**: ALB in public subnets, pods in private subnets
- **Service Discovery**: kube-proxy watches both Services and Endpoints to maintain iptables rules

### AWS-Specific Considerations
- AWS VPC CNI assigns real VPC IPs to pods (not overlay network)
- Cloud Controller Manager handles AWS integrations (LoadBalancers, node lifecycle)
- AWS Load Balancer Controller watches Endpoints to register pod IPs in ALB Target Groups

## Communication Preferences

### Learning Sessions - EFFECTIVE METHODOLOGY (Use This!)
The owner learns best with this proven approach:

1. **Small Topics**: Break down each major topic into digestible sub-topics
2. **One at a Time**: Present ONE concept, wait for questions/clarification, then move to next
3. **Immediate Reinforcement**: After explaining each sub-topic, ask if there are questions
4. **Quiz Before Moving On**: Test understanding with scenario-based questions before marking topic complete
5. **Allow Self-Explanation**: Let the owner explain concepts back to confirm understanding

**DO NOT:**
- Dump all sub-topics at once (overwhelming cognitive load)
- Move to next concept without confirmation of understanding
- Skip the quiz/retention check phase

**Example flow:**
1. Explain Taints ‚Üí answer questions ‚Üí confirm understanding
2. Explain Tolerations ‚Üí answer questions ‚Üí confirm understanding
3. Explain NodeSelectors ‚Üí answer questions ‚Üí confirm understanding
4. Quiz on all three ‚Üí grade answers ‚Üí update learning docs

### Documentation
- Track learning progress and keep markdown files up to date after each topic completion
- Update retention scores in both learning-plan.md and learning-progress.md
- Add new mental models to learning-progress.md as they emerge
