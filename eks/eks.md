I need you to be my teacher
I am working with some strong developers and its giving me a bit of imposter syndrome
They want to build out an observability platform for apps running in EKS using prometheus and AWS hosted grafana. 
I need to start by learning the ins and outs of EKS and Kubernetes
I want write some terraform to build my own EKS cluster
I then want to build a small web app/db stack running in that cluster. 
I then want to build an observability prototype using prometheus and hosted grafana
I then want to build out some SLOs
